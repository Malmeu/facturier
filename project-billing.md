Project Specification: Billing, Order, and Delivery Note Web App (MVP)
1. Project Overview
Develop a professional web application for managing invoices, purchase orders, and delivery notes. The app should provide an easy-to-use interface with a WYSIWYG editor and customizable templates to quickly generate documents. The product targets the Algerian market, so local regulations and language considerations must be taken into account.

Ensure data security and privacy as per local standards.

Consider mobile-friendliness but focus mainly on desktop/tablet usability initially.
